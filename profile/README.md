## 🎮 What is a Starfield Trainer?

A **trainer** is a standalone cheat app that runs next to your game and injects powerful real-time tweaks. Unlike in-game console commands or mods, a trainer offers **hotkey-enabled cheats** that can be turned on/off at any moment without modding your game files.

Think of it as a dev-mode console with way more flexibility. Perfect for single-player domination.
